I could get better at this game playing with these opponents.","1":"","2":"I thought I saw duplicate cards sometimes but cannot remember. Felt like my partner unnecessarily played high cards off suit which should have been saved for other hands or played high cards when I already had the trick. ","3":"No problems. Where the hands all the same? or is my pattern recognition wigging out ha!","4":"","5":"","6":"","7":"","8":"","9":"In final round, cards were played out of order. I led the trick, then east played, then west, then south.","10":"","11":"","12":"","13":"","14":"","15":"Felt like the last bot played a bad hand in the first game wasting a trump, but then in the second game I think it did the opposite. It is hard to keep track of what the bot actually had in its hands to know how well it played within the constraints of the rules.","16":"","17":"","18":"When the hand is given to the player, having it ordered by color (red\/black\/red\/black) and by strength could be nice! Otherwise, very good :)","19":"I think it would be easier for non-math people if you renamed the bots as 'A'bot, 'B'bot, 'C'bot, as not many might be familiar with the Greek notations and may not remember which bot was which. I was also confused when the 'East' side was on my left instead of on my right. Other than that, interesting game!","20":"","21":"","22":"Really interesting, would love to hear your conclusions at the end!","23":"","24":"Very interesting study, using bots with different characteristics. Only minor comment was that I could not get the game to load on my previous attempt, but clearing the cookies did the trick","25":"","26":"- first time i logged in to play i couldn't click any of the cards, logging in with a different name fixed it.\n- sometimes the cards would render out of order.\n- i suspect my learning to play the game across these rounds would have had a bigger impact than the choice of partner.\n- how did my digital partner rate my play???","27":"","28":"","29":"","30":"","31":"","32":"","33":"","34":"","35":"","36":"I didnt understand the game\/strategies fully until probably the last few games (I am like that w cards\/board games) but now I wish I could go back and try new strategies!","37":"","38":"","39":"","40":"","41":""}}
