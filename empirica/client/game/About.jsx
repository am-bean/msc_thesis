        <p>This game is part of an experiment into human-AI cooperation 
    run by researchers at the University of Oxford. Each of the four agents being
    tested were trained with different techniques, and the goal is to see which ones
    perform best in a cooperative setting with human partners. </p>
    <p>For more information, you can contact Andrew Bean at andrew.bean@oii.ox.ac.uk,
         who is running this experiment for a Master's thesis.
