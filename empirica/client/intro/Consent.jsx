          The aim of this research project is to improve the ability of AI agents
          to be good collaborators with humans. In this study, we are focused on
          AI training methods which lead to a better understanding of new human
          partners. We have built a set of AIs trained with various techniques to
          play a card game. We now seek to compare how well the AIs can cooperate with 
          human partners.

          You may ask any questions before deciding to take part by contacting
          the researcher (details below). The Principal Researcher is Andrew Bean, 
          who is attached to the Oxford Internet Institute at the University of 
          Oxford. This project is being completed under the supervision of Dr Luc 
          Rocher and Dr Adam Mahdi. Participants will be asked to read the rules 
          of a card game, complete a few practices to ensure understanding, and 
          then play several rounds with an AI partner. Afterwards, we will ask 
          you about your experience. This should take about 30 minutes. No 
          background knowledge is required. We will collect your scores on the 
          practice examples and the state of the game (who has which cards, and 
          which actions are taken) for each round of cards. The data will be used 
          to assess which AI agents are best able to coordinate with human play.
